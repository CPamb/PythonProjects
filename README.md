# 100 Days of Programming Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Programming and Cybersecurity Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository serves as a public journal of my journey to strengthen my programming skills and become a proficient contributor in the cybersecurity sector. Over the next 100 days, I will be actively working on various projects, honing my coding abilities, and deepening my understanding of coding concepts.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this challenge is self-improvement. By dedicating focused time each day, I aim to enhance my programming proficiency and gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity. This journey is not only about coding; it's a holistic approach to becoming a well-rounded professional in the cybersecurity domain.
