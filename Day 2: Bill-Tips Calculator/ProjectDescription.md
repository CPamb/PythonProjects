# Tip Calculator

Welcome to the Tip Calculator project! This Python script simplifies the process of splitting a bill, including a specified tip percentage, among a group of people. Whether you're dining out with friends or sharing expenses, this tool helps you calculate each person's contribution accurately.

## How to Use

1. **Input Bill Amount:**
   - When prompted, enter the total bill amount in pounds (£).

2. **Input Tip Percentage:**
   - Choose a tip percentage from the provided options: 10%, 12%, or 15%.

3. **Split Bill:**
   - Enter the number of people sharing the bill.

The script will then compute the total bill with the tip included and divide it by the number of people, providing the amount each person should contribute.
